## Description

This project was developed by me and a few colleagues for a high school project in 2019.

Our goal was to use technology to improve/promote a local entrepreneur's business.

We chose the business of [Marcos Melo](https://www.instagram.com/marcosmelo501?igsh=enA0bHBiZGZhejky), a local environmental artisan who makes art and all kinds of structures out of used tires, reducing their environmental impact.

To improve the visibility of his work, we created this tutorial app in which he teaches how to build some structures.

## The development process

I initially chose to develop this app using React Native, but changed to Flutter halfway through it due to some issues with video playing.

It was my first experience with Flutter and mobile app development, so there are several architecture flaws, and some of them were deliberate due to an upcoming deadline. I might fix them later on, but don't hold your breath.
